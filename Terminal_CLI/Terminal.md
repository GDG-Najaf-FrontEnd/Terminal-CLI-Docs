## Terminal

A **Terminal** is a program known as command lines or consoles, is a
fundamental part of computers that we can interact with, and allows us
to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a
graphical user interface. Using a terminal allows us to send simple text
commands to our computer to do things like navigate through a directory
or copy a file, and form the basis for many more complex automation and
programming skills.

### Why the terminal?

Accomplishing tasks with the **Terminal** is much faster than the usual
ways we used to. Furthermore, with Terminal, you can access the internal
CPU and other networks and computers.

In addition, every single developer needs it for handling most things
needed in the coding environment like

1. Installing specific packages, updates, export, and import your work to platforms like GitHub

2. Code testing

3. Error display

**Terminal** is a powerful tool and is going to be clearer in the next
upcoming sessions. you will get used to it so donâ€™t worry. ðŸ˜‰

### Installation:

  - In Mac/Linux, Terminal is a pre-installed program on the system. (You donâ€™t need to install it)
you can open the terminal by pressing the "Command" key and the space bar at the same time, and when Spotlight opens, just type "Terminal".

  -  Windows has a separate command-line language from *Mac/Linux*. But to be able to use the same commands as the instructor will, download [<span class="underline">Git Bash</span>](https://git-scm.com/download/win). and follow the instructions.

3rd option\\ Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command
Prompt.
