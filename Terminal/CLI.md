## CLI

## CLI stands for

  - Command Line Interface.

  - Command Line Interpreter.

  - Command-Line Input.

## What are they used for?

CLI is a command-line program that accepts text input to execute
operating system functions.

By typing commands in the **Terminal**, you can access files, install
programs, modify programs, get information about various things (for
example, check things like package loss and speed of your internet) and
do more or less everything else as well.

\* In the 1960s, using only computer terminals was the only way to
interact with computers.
